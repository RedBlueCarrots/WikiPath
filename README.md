# WikiPath

Requires python3 and pip

Setup instructions:

MAKE SURE you are in the uppermost wikipath directory
Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

- WINDOWS :

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- UNIX:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Pip installs:

```
pip install flask
pip install python-dotenv
pip install flask-wtf
```

Please edit this file as we make more progress if you need to install more files

To run, simply :

```
flask run
```

And if everything was setup and configured right you should run on port 5000.

Now you can just open the virtual environment and run flask if you want to use the server again.
